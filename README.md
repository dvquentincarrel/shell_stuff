## Purpose

This repo features a bunch of scripts and configs related to
the use of my shell (currently `bash`).

## Setting up
Running the `setup.sh` should be enough.  
The installation script puts everything in your `~/.local/bin` dir by default.
You scan specify another directory as an argument like `./setup.sh ~/my_bins`.  
I do not guarantee it will work with names that contain spaces or special characters.

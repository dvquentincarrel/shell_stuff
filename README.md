## Purpose

This repo features a bunch of scripts and configs related to
the use of my linux environment (i3, tmux, bash, ...)

## Setting up
Running the `make` should be enough. Most things are installed under ~/.config/.../
Executables are installed under ~/.local/bin/  
Run `make clobber=f` to force symlink creation
